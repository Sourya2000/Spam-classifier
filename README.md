# Email spam classifer 

# Steps involved:

-- Data cleaning and preprocessing
-- Statistical data analysis and visualization 
-- Tokenization and vectorization of words
-- Model training and validation
-- Classifying Emails as Spam and Not spam


# Model trainig and classifer:

-- Implemented three naive bayes classifiers to achieve comapratively better precision
-- Mutinomial Naive Bayes performed better with an precision of 1.0
-- Considered multinomialNB for model building 


# Prediction:

Created full stack app using streamlit to predict the emails as spam or not spam
